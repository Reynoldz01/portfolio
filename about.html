            <h5>About Me</h5>
            <p2>Hello, I am Marcus Reynolds! I am currently a freelance web developer and run a coffee shop.
                <br><br>
                Age: 23 <br>
                Location: Newcastle Upon Tyne, England
                <br><br><br>
                
                I specialise in both front end and backend website development, php, html, js, python, SQL. <br>I am currently also 
                finishing my undergrad computer science degree with extra credit web development modules.<br>
                Currently, I freelance (mainly wordpress websites/shopify) but I also offer full custom web packages. <br>
                You can view more by navigating to my website portfolio page when you are finished reading.
                <br><br><br>
                Outside of web development and university, I run a coffee shop. I am also currently competing in the UK Barista of the year Championships. This is fun, however I think it's time I move more into web development, so I have been working a little less 
                to work on some web development projects, mainly through self advertising on Meta/Facebook and Fiverr.com. It's a lot of work, maybe 60-80 hours a week, so it's time to get my creativity skills and team leadership and move into web design rather than working on so many different passions/projects. For any job enquiries, visit the contact me page.
